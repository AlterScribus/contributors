#ASAP

- rename the files and classes to match the schema i've defined in the sample plugin for the scribus development manual
  epubexportplugin
  epubexportdialog
  epubexport
- mail to change shift-breakline to behave as <br> -> better compatibility with HTML;
  current shift-newline can still be achieved with shift-newline+forced justified
  i've never seen used and it's only slightly more complicated than before.
  on the other hand cross production (import / export of html) is made much easier!
- implement TOC with the fix h\d.* style names until cezary implements a real TOC in 1.5
- correctly set dtb:depth with the TOC depth (TODO)


BEFORE 1.0

- add the font files
- font sizes: 12 pt = 16px = 1 em = 100%
- convert all colors to rgb
- optionally (?) use h1 to break into files
- detect lists (option = glyph to look for <- no use cezary's lists!); if we're on a list retain the indent 
- correctly handle images that are used multiple times in a file
- crop images to the shape
- for images where the resolution is defined, keep the size (in px???)
- select directory where to put the ebook
- in document settings optionally define the directory where low resolution images are placed (this can be useful for pdf created for the web)
- keeping the colors of the text and the background of frames should be an option
- what happens if a char and a para style have the same name? always create a span to apply the character style?
- correctly set the language in the metadata (TODO)
- store the generated UUID in the document configuration (TODO)
- all file names must have ASCII chars only (manage the clashes when renaming)
	- Your filenames have spaces or encoded characters. If your EPUB has any spaces in filenames, be sure the spaces are properly encoded in the EPUB manifest by using "%20" in their place. Filenames may not contain periods (“.”) other than to separate the filename from its extension.
- check that the cover is correctly generated as as a jpg with 1400px height (generate a png and convert it to jpg)
- cover:
      <div>
        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" height="100%" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 600 800" width="100%">
          <image height="800" width="600" xlink:href="../Images/cover.jpeg"></image>
        </svg>
      </div>
- patch scribus to enable an identifier type in the document information (#11055)
- don't include images which are not on the page (how can i check if it's on a page or not?)
- check that for each section a new file is created (should already be so)



LATER
- eventually and optionally set the chapter title as the name of the section in the epub file (TODO)
- eventually store the epu date in the document configuration (TODO)
- define the condition under which a new span builds upon the current one or replaces it. (as an example: if a font is defined and it does not change, build upon it)
- show the document infos in the export dialog
- add the footnotes as soon cezary's code is in the trunk (http://blog.epubbooks.com/183/creating-an-epub-document)
- add a checkbox to open the created epub with an application (sigil) and let it set in the preferences
- groups only containing shapes (no text nor images) should be exported as svg
- patch scribus to enable an authorFileAs the document information (lastname, first,)
	- should the document information also be in the preferences (mostly not needed, but some fields can be handy for epub in some cases
- we may need to obfuscate fonts on demand (or leave it to sigil?) (Sigil/Importers/ImportEPUB.cpp FontObfuscation; Sigil/Misc/FontObfuscation)
- QDomDocument has some limitations (like putting newlines around <span>s): in the future we should probably rather use SAX
