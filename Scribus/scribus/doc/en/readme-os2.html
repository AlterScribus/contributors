<h2>Scribus on OS/2- Read Me</h2>
<p>
Scribus is an open-source program that brings award-winning
professional page layout to Linux/Unix, MacOS X and Windows
desktops with a combination of "press-ready" output and 
new approaches to page layout.</p>

<p>Underneath the modern and user friendly interface, Scribus 
supports professional publishing features, such as CMYK color,
separations, ICC color management and versatile PDF creation.</p>

<p>Requires libc061.dll - which is available from ftp://ftp.netlabs.org/pub/gcc/libc-0.6.1-csd1.zip</p>

<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul><li>If a file called fonts.conf doesn't exist in %HOME%\fonts.conf,
one will be created automatically when scribus.exe is run for the
first time, however, Scribus will crash with signal 11.
On the 2nd attempt to load scribus.exe, it will load fine.</li>
<li>Printing support is not complete, but PDF export is, you can easily print
via Acrobat Reader or another PDF viewer as a temporary workaround.</li></ul>

<p>Updated in beta 2:</p>
-<ul><li> Moved to cairo as a rendering engine - cair1310.dll included in package</li>
- <li>Most plugins are now working</li>
- <li>Text entered in a text box now displays instantly rather than requiring a forced redraw</li>
- <li>All languages supported by Scribus are now available</li></ul>
