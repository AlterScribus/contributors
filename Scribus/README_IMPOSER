#Goal

Implement some simple imposing plans for the PDF creation in Scribus.

#Introduction

Uses Podofo to impose the PDF created by Scribus and produce an imposed PDF.

Currently, the code works for four default plans:
- birthday card (2-way folding)
- magazine (2-Fold with left pages counting from page 1 and right pages counting from last page down)
- multifold (N-Fold, one direction, fixed to N = 3 in current code base)
- business card (X times Y grid of each page on one separate sheet. X and Y are hardcoded 3 and 4 now.
- tiling: BROKEN
- external file: BROKEN

A new tab is available on the PDF export dialog. Although it presents multiple options, only the imposer selection works. The rest is work in progress.

#Where is the code

#Tasks



#Todo

- improve GUI, save / restore settings to file
- further integration of code base, original podofo-impose code was not Qt based.
- Features: Configuration, paper rotation, etc.


#Further work


#Further ideas

- manage the imposition process by Scribus scripting?
- use external imposition plans
