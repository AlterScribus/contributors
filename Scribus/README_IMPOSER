#Goal

Implement some simple imposing plans for the PDF creation in Scribus.

#Introduction

Uses Podofo to impose the PDF created by Scribus and produce an imposed PDF.

Currently, the code works for four default plans:
- birthday card (2-way folding)
- magazine (2-Fold with left pages counting from page 1 and right pages counting from last page down)
- multifold (N-Fold, one direction, broken in current code base)
- business card (X times Y grid of each page on one separate sheet. X and Y are hardcoded 3 and 4 now.

When exporting to PDF, the imposer is always enabled in this branch. Currently the imposing plan is hardcoded to the magazine style imposing, the GUI to select imposition is still missing. You can test different imposition plans by modifying the imposer::impose procedure in .scribus/imposer/imposer.cpp 

#Where is the code
