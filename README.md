contributors
============
Contributor's repository is the repository that was made available by Malex on scribus official servers for alternative developpements and contributions : git://git.scribus.net/scribus.git
It was used by several contributors, and produced some interesting branches :

- In footnotes_fix branch, cezary tested and fixed bugs relating to footnotes. His works fixed some bugs, fixed partially some of them and didnt fix other bugs. Most of these fixing works have not been merged (at least the latest).

- Ale worked on an "export to epub" feature in the "epub" branch. It was supposed to be ok, but not satisfactory, which led to a refactoring in a "epub_modular" new branch, which was later also abandonned.

- 'imposer' branch includes works on imposing. AFAICT there were some very powerfull features but it required adjustements with bleeds.

- Chelen created the unitLoader branch so as to test the new unit loader UI. Nice usability improvements have been reached and patches have been proposed in the bug tracker. Still waiting to be merded.

- Many other, see for yourself.
